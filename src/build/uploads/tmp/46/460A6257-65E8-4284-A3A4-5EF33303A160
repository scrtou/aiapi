{"model":"GPT-5.2 Pro","temperature":0,"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.\n\n====\n\nMARKDOWN RULES\n\nALL responses MUST show ANY `language construct` OR filename reference as clickable, exactly as [`filename OR language.declaration()`](relative/file/path.ext:line); line is required for `syntax` and optional for filename links. This applies to ALL markdown responses and ALSO those in attempt_completion\n\n====\n\nTOOL USE\n\nYou have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. Use the provider-native tool-calling mechanism. Do not include XML markup or examples. You must call at least one tool per assistant response. Prefer calling as many tools as are reasonably needed in a single response to reduce back-and-forth and complete tasks faster.\n\n\t# Tool Use Guidelines\n\n1. Assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.\n2. Choose the most appropriate tool based on the task and the tool descriptions provided. Assess if you need additional information to proceed, and which of the available tools would be most effective for gathering this information. For example using the list_files tool is more effective than running a command like `ls` in the terminal. It's critical that you think about each available tool and use the one that best fits the current step in the task.\n3. If multiple actions are needed, you may use multiple tools in a single message when appropriate, or use tools iteratively across messages. Each tool use should be informed by the results of previous tool uses. Do not assume the outcome of any tool use. Each step must be informed by the previous step's result.\n\nBy carefully considering the user's response after tool executions, you can react accordingly and make informed decisions about how to proceed with the task. This iterative process helps ensure the overall success and accuracy of your work.\n\n====\n\nCAPABILITIES\n\n- You have access to tools that let you execute CLI commands on the user's computer, list files, view source code definitions, regex search, read and write files, and ask follow-up questions. These tools help you effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks, such as writing code, making edits or improvements to existing files, understanding the current state of a project, performing system operations, and much more.\n- When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/home/useryx/codespace') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.\n- You can use the execute_command tool to run commands on the user's computer whenever you feel it can help accomplish the user's task. When you need to execute a CLI command, you must provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, since they are more flexible and easier to run. Interactive and long-running commands are allowed, since the commands are run in the user's VSCode terminal. The user may keep commands running in the background and you will be kept updated on their status along the way. Each command you execute is run in a new terminal instance.\n\n====\n\nMODES\n\n- These are the currently available modes:\n  * \"🏗️ Architect\" mode (architect) - Use this mode when you need to plan, design, or strategize before implementation. Perfect for breaking down complex problems, creating technical specifications, designing system architecture, or brainstorming solutions before coding.\n  * \"💻 Code\" mode (code) - Use this mode when you need to write, modify, or refactor code. Ideal for implementing features, fixing bugs, creating new files, or making code improvements across any programming language or framework.\n  * \"❓ Ask\" mode (ask) - Use this mode when you need explanations, documentation, or answers to technical questions. Best for understanding concepts, analyzing existing code, getting recommendations, or learning about technologies without making changes.\n  * \"🪲 Debug\" mode (debug) - Use this mode when you're troubleshooting issues, investigating errors, or diagnosing problems. Specialized in systematic debugging, adding logging, analyzing stack traces, and identifying root causes before applying fixes.\n  * \"🪃 Orchestrator\" mode (orchestrator) - Use this mode for complex, multi-step projects that require coordination across different specialties. Ideal when you need to break down large tasks into subtasks, manage workflows, or coordinate work that spans multiple domains or expertise areas.\n\n====\n\nAVAILABLE SKILLS\n\n<available_skills>\n  <skill>\n    <name>create-mcp-server</name>\n    <description>Instructions for creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that expose tools and resources for the agent to use.

However, commands may change directories in terminals, so respect working directory specified by the response to execute_command.\n- You cannot `cd` into a different directory to complete a task. You are stuck operating from '/home/useryx/codespace', so be sure to pass in the correct 'path' parameter when using tools that require a path.\n- Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.\n- Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user's environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory '/home/useryx/codespace', and if so prepend with `cd`'ing into that directory && then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from '/home/useryx/codespace'). For example, if you needed to run `npm install` in a project outside of '/home/useryx/codespace', you would need to prepend with a `cd` i.e. pseudocode for this would be `cd (path to project) && (command, in this case npm install)`.\n- Some modes have restrictions on which files they can edit. If you attempt to edit a restricted file, the operation will be rejected with a FileRestrictionError that will specify which file patterns are allowed for the current mode.\n- Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project's manifest file would help you understand the project's dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.\n  * For example, in architect mode trying to edit app.js would be rejected because architect mode can only edit files matching \"\\.md$\"\n- When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project's coding standards and best practices.\n- Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user's request efficiently and effectively. When you've completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.\n- You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. When you ask a question, provide the user with 2-4 suggested answers based on your question so they don't need to do so much typing. The suggestions should be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task. They should be ordered by priority or logical sequence. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.\n- When executing commands, if you don't see the expected output, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task. The user's terminal may be unable to stream the output back properly. If you absolutely need to see the actual terminal output, use the ask_followup_question tool to request the user to copy and paste it back to you.\n- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.\n- Your goal is to try to accomplish the user's task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.\n- NEVER end attempt_completion result with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.\n- You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with \"Great\", \"Certainly\", \"Okay\", \"Sure\". You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point. For example you should NOT say \"Great, I've updated the CSS\" but instead something like \"I've updated the CSS\". It is important you be clear and technical in your messages.\n- When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.\n- At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.\n- Before executing commands, check the \"Actively Running Terminals\" section in environment_details. If present, consider how these active processes might impact your task. For example, if a local development server is already running, you wouldn't need to start it again. If no active terminals are listed, proceed with command execution as normal.\n- MCP operations should be used one at a time, similar to other tool usage. Wait for confirmation of success before proceeding with additional operations.\n- It is critical you wait for the user's response after each tool use, in order to confirm the success of the tool use. For example, if asked to make a todo app, you would create a file, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, then create another file if needed, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, etc.\n\n====\n\nSYSTEM INFORMATION\n\nOperating System: Linux 6.1\nDefault Shell: /bin/bash\nHome Directory: /home/useryx\nCurrent Workspace Directory: /home/useryx/codespace\n\nThe Current Workspace Directory is the active VS Code project directory, and is therefore the default directory for all tool operations. New terminals will be created in the current workspace directory, however if you change directories in a terminal it will then have a different working directory; changing directories in a terminal does not modify the workspace directory, because you do not have access to change the workspace directory. When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/test/path') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.\n\n====\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n1. Analyze the user's task and set clear, achievable goals to accomplish it. Prioritize these goals in a logical order.\n2. Work through these goals sequentially, utilizing available tools one at a time as necessary. Each goal should correspond to a distinct step in your problem-solving process. You will be informed on the work completed and what's remaining as you go.\n3. Remember, you have extensive capabilities with access to a wide range of tools that can be used in powerful and clever ways as necessary to accomplish each goal. Before calling a tool, do some analysis. First, analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to gain context and insights for proceeding effectively. Next, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user's task. Go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, proceed with the tool use. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the tool (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.\n4. Once you've completed the user's task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user.\n5. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again. But DO NOT continue in pointless back and forth conversations, i.e. don't end your responses with questions or offers for further assistance.\n\n\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"简体中文\" (zh-CN) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<user_message>\n'aiapi/src/build/logs/aiapiKilo.log' 'aiapi/' 这是客户端使用kilo时的日志，为什么出现【20260206 22:50:27.387384 600020 ERROR [生成服务] 执行门控会话异常: Type is not convertible to string -

It's critical that you think about each available tool and use the one that best fits the current step in the task.\\n3. If multiple actions are needed, use one tool at a time per message to accomplish the task iteratively, with each tool use being informed by the result of the previous tool use. Do not assume the outcome of any tool use. Each step must be informed by the previous step's result.\\n4. After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use. This result will provide you with the necessary information to continue your task or make f...\n160 | 20260206 22:50:28.671066 600017 INFO  [API接口] 流式模式: 1 - AiApi.cc:76\n161 | 20260206 22:50:28.671076 600017 INFO  [API接口] 使用 RequestAdapters 构建 GenerationRequest -

| 事件类型 | 说明 | 数据 |\n142 | |----------|------|------|\n143 | | `Started` | 生成开始 | responseId, model |\n144 | | `OutputTextDelta` | 文本增量（流式） | delta, index, outputItemIndex(可选) |\n145 | | `OutputTextDone` | 文本完成 | text, index |\n146 | | `ToolCallDone` | 工具调用完成 | id, name, arguments, index |\n147 | | `Usage` | Token 使用量 | inputTokens, outputTokens |\n148 | | `Completed` | 生成完成 | finishReason, usage(可选) |\n149 | | `Error` | 错误 | code, message, detail |\n150 | \n151 | ### IResponseSink（输出通道接口）\n152 | \n153 | 将 `GenerationEvent` 转换为具体协议格式：\n154 | \n155 | ```cpp\n156 | class IResponseSink {\n157 |     virtual void onEvent(const generation::GenerationEvent& event) = 0;\n158 |     virtual void onClose() = 0;\n159 |     virtual std::string getSinkType() const = 0;\n160 | };\n161 | ```\n162 | \n163 | 内置实现：\n164 | - `ChatJsonSink` - Chat Completions 非流式 JSON\n165 | - `ChatSseSink` - Chat Completions 流式 SSE  \n166 | - `ResponsesSseSink` - Responses API 流式 SSE\n167 | - `NullSink` - 丢弃输出（测试用）\n168 | - `CollectorSink` - 收集事件（测试用）\n169 | \n170 | ### GenerationService（生成编排服务）\n171 | \n172 | 核心编排服务，负责整个生成流程：\n173 | \n174 | ```cpp\n175 | class GenerationService {\n176 | public:\n177 |     // 主入口：带并发门控的生成\n178 |     void runGuarded(\n179 |         const GenerationRequest& request,\n180 |         std::shared_ptr<IResponseSink> sink,\n181 |         session::ConcurrencyPolicy policy\n182 |     );\n183 |     \n184 | private:\n185 |     session_st materializeSession(const GenerationRequest& request);\n186 |     std::string computeExecutionKey(const session_st& session);\n187 |     ProviderResult executeProvider(session_st& session, const GenerationRequest& request);\n188 |     void emitResultEvents(const ProviderResult& result, std::shared_ptr<IResponseSink> sink);\n189 |     std::string sanitizeOutput(const std::string& output, const GenerationRequest& request);\n190 |     void processOutputWithBridge(const std::string& output, ...);\n191 |     std::vector<generation::ToolCallDone> parseXmlToolCalls(const std::string& text);\n192 |     generation::ToolCallDone generateForcedToolCall(const Json::Value& tools);\n193 |     void normalizeToolCallArguments(generation::ToolCallDone& call, const Json::Value& toolDef);\n194 |     bool selfHealReadFile(generation::ToolCallDone& call);\n195 |     void applyStrictClientRules(generation::ToolCallDone& call, const Json::Value& clientInfo);\n196 | };\n197 | ```\n198 | \n199 | ### SessionExecutionGate（并发门控）\n200 | \n201 | 防止同一会话并发执行：\n202 | \n203 | ```cpp\n204 | namespace session {\n205 | \n206 | enum class ConcurrencyPolicy {\n207 |     RejectConcurrent,   // 拒绝并发请求（返回 409 Conflict）\n208 |     CancelPrevious      // 取消之前的请求，执行新请求\n209 | };\n210 | \n211 | enum class GateResult {\n212 |     Acquired,           // 成功获取执行权\n213 |     Rejected,           // 被拒绝\n214 |     Cancelled           // 之前的请求被取消\n215 | };\n216 | \n217 | class SessionExecutionGate {\n218 | public:\n219 |     static SessionExecutionGate& getInstance();\n220 |     GateResult tryAcquire(const std::string& sessionKey, ConcurrencyPolicy policy, CancellationTokenPtr& outToken);\n221 |     void release(const std::string& sessionKey);\n222 |     bool isExecuting(const std::string& sessionKey) const;\n223 |     void cleanup(size_t maxIdleSlots = 1000);\n224 | };\n225 | \n226 | // RAII 风格的执行守卫\n227 | class ExecutionGuard {\n228 | public:\n229 |     ExecutionGuard(const std::string& sessionKey, ConcurrencyPolicy policy = ConcurrencyPolicy::RejectConcurrent);\n230 |     ~ExecutionGuard();  // 自动释放\n231 |     bool isAcquired() const;\n232 |     GateResult getResult() const;\n233 |     CancellationTokenPtr getToken() const;\n234 |     bool isCancelled() const;\n235 | };\n236 | \n237 | } // namespace session\n238 | ```\n239 | \n240 | ### ToolCallBridge（工具调用桥接）\n241 | \n242 | 为不原生支持工具调用的模型提供桥接：\n243 | \n244 | - **Native 模式**：直接透传原生 tool calls\n245 | - **TextBridge 模式**：\n246 |   - 请求侧：将工具定义转换为 XML 注入 system prompt\n247 |   - 响应侧：解析模型输出中的 XML 工具调用\n248 | \n249 | ### ToolCallValidator（工具调用验证）\n250 | \n251 | 验证模型生成的工具调用是否符合工具定义，支持三种校验模式：\n252 | \n253 | ```cpp\n254 | namespace toolcall {\n255 | \n256 | // 校验模式\n257 | enum class ValidationMode {\n258 |     None,      // 不校验 - 信任 AI 输出，只解析 JSON\n259 |     Relaxed,   // 宽松校验 - 只校验关键字段（path, content 等必须非空）\n260 |     Strict     // 严格校验 - 完整 schema 校验（所有 required + 类型检查）\n261 | };\n262 | \n263 | // 校验结果\n264 | struct ValidationResult {\n265 |     bool valid = false;\n266 |     std::string errorMessage;\n267 |     \n268 |     static ValidationResult success();\n269 |     static ValidationResult failure(const std::string& msg);\n270 | };\n271 | \n272 | class ToolCallValidator {\n273 | public:\n274 |     // 构造时传入工具定义和客户端类型\n275 |     explicit ToolCallValidator(const Json::Value& toolDefs, const std::string& clientType = \"\");\n276 |     \n277 |     // 校验单个工具调用\n278 |     ValidationResult validate(\n279 |         const generation::ToolCallDone& toolCall,\n280 |         ValidationMode mode = ValidationMode::None\n281 |     ) const;\n282 |     \n283 |     // 过滤无效的工具调用\n284 |     size_t filterInvalidToolCalls(\n285 |         std::vector<generation::ToolCallDone>& toolCalls,\n286 |         std::string& discardedText,\n287 |         ValidationMode mode = ValidationMode::None\n288 |     ) const;\n289 |     \n290 |     // 检查工具名是否存在\n291 |     bool hasToolDefinition(const std::string& toolName) const;\n292 |     \n293 |     // 获取有效工具名集合\n294 |     const std::unordered_set<std::string>& getValidToolNames() const;\n295 |     \n296 |     // 获取客户端类型\n297 |     const std::string& getClientType() const;\n298 | };\n299 | \n300 | // 降级策略\n301 | enum class FallbackStrategy {\n302 |     DiscardOnly,           // 仅丢弃无效工具调用\n303 |     WrapAttemptCompletion, // 包装为 attempt_completion\n304 |     GenerateReadFile       // 生成 read_file 降级调用\n305 | };\n306 | \n307 | // 辅助函数\n308 | bool isStrictToolClient(const std::string& clientType);\n309 | ValidationMode getRecommendedValidationMode(const std::string& clientType);\n310 | \n311 | } // namespace toolcall\n312 | ```\n313 | \n314 | ### ClientOutputSanitizer（输出清洗）\n315 | \n316 | 修正模型常见的输出错误：\n317 | \n318 | - 修正标签拼写错误\n319 | - 去除非法控制字符\n320 | - 根据客户端类型应用不同的清洗规则\n321 | \n322 | ### Session（会话追踪）\n323 | \n324 | 支持两种追踪模式：\n325 | \n326 | | 模式 | 实现 | 说明 |\n327 | |------|------|------|\n328 | | Hash | 消息内容 SHA256 | 默认模式，简单可靠 |\n329 | | ZeroWidth | 零宽字符嵌入 | 对用户不可见的 sessionId |\n330 | \n331 | ```cpp\n332 | // 会话追踪模式\n333 | enum class TrackingMode {\n334 |     Hash,       // SHA256 哈希追踪（默认）\n335 |     ZeroWidth   // 零宽字符嵌入追踪\n336 | };\n337 | \n338 | // 会话结构\n339 | struct session_st {\n340 |     std::string sessionId;           // 会话 ID\n341 |     std::string systemPrompt;        // 系统提示词\n342 |     std::string systemPromptHash;    // 系统提示词哈希\n343 |     std::string contextHash;         // 上下文哈希\n344 |     TrackingMode trackingMode;       // 追踪模式\n345 |     bool useTextBridge;              // 是否使用文本桥接\n346 |     std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point lastActivityTime;  // 最后活动时间\n347 |     std::vector<Message> conversationHistory;  // 会话历史\n348 | };\n349 | ```\n350 | \n351 | ### Errors（统一错误模型）\n352 | \n353 | 统一的错误类型与 HTTP 状态码映射：\n354 | \n355 | ```cpp\n356 | namespace error {\n357 | \n358 | enum class ErrorCode {\n359 |     None, BadRequest, Unauthorized, Forbidden, NotFound,\n360 |     Conflict, RateLimited, Timeout, ProviderError, Internal, Cancelled\n361 | };\n362 | \n363 | struct AppError {\n364 |     ErrorCode code;\n365 |     std::string message;\n366 |     std::string detail;\n367 |     std::string providerCode;\n368 |     \n369 |     bool hasError() const;\n370 |     int httpStatus() const;\n371 |     std::string type() const;\n372 |     \n373 |     // 工厂方法\n374 |     static AppError badRequest(const std::string& msg, const std::string& detail = \"\");\n375 |     static AppError unauthorized(const std::string& msg = \"Unauthorized\");\n376 |     static AppError forbidden(const std::string& msg = \"Forbidden\");\n377 |     static AppError notFound(const std::string& msg = \"Not found\");\n378 |     static AppError conflict(const std::string& msg, const std::string& detail = \"\");\n379 |     static AppError rateLimited(const std::string& msg = \"Rate limited\");\n380 |     static AppError timeout(const std::string& msg = \"Request timeout\");\n381 |     static AppError providerError(const std::string& msg, const std::string& providerCode = \"\");\n382 |     static AppError internal(const std::string& msg, const std::string& detail = \"\");\n383 |     static AppError cancelled(const std::string& msg = \"Request cancelled\");\n384 | };\n385 | \n386 | } // namespace error\n387 | ```\n388 | \n389 | ## API 接口\n390 | \n391 | ### Chat Completions API\n392 | \n393 | ```bash\n394 | #
