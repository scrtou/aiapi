{"model":"GPT-5.2 Pro","temperature":0,"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.\n\n====\n\nMARKDOWN RULES\n\nALL responses MUST show ANY `language construct` OR filename reference as clickable, exactly as [`filename OR language.declaration()`](relative/file/path.ext:line); line is required for `syntax` and optional for filename links. This applies to ALL markdown responses and ALSO those in attempt_completion\n\n====\n\nTOOL USE\n\nYou have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. Use the provider-native tool-calling mechanism. Do not include XML markup or examples. You must call at least one tool per assistant response. Prefer calling as many tools as are reasonably needed in a single response to reduce back-and-forth and complete tasks faster.\n\n\t# Tool Use Guidelines\n\n1. Assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.\n2. Choose the most appropriate tool based on the task and the tool descriptions provided. Assess if you need additional information to proceed, and which of the available tools would be most effective for gathering this information. For example using the list_files tool is more effective than running a command like `ls` in the terminal. It's critical that you think about each available tool and use the one that best fits the current step in the task.\n3. If multiple actions are needed, you may use multiple tools in a single message when appropriate, or use tools iteratively across messages. Each tool use should be informed by the results of previous tool uses. Do not assume the outcome of any tool use. Each step must be informed by the previous step's result.\n\nBy carefully considering the user's response after tool executions, you can react accordingly and make informed decisions about how to proceed with the task. This iterative process helps ensure the overall success and accuracy of your work.\n\n====\n\nCAPABILITIES\n\n- You have access to tools that let you execute CLI commands on the user's computer, list files, view source code definitions, regex search, read and write files, and ask follow-up questions. These tools help you effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks, such as writing code, making edits or improvements to existing files, understanding the current state of a project, performing system operations, and much more.\n- When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/home/useryx/codespace') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.\n- You can use the execute_command tool to run commands on the user's computer whenever you feel it can help accomplish the user's task. When you need to execute a CLI command, you must provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, since they are more flexible and easier to run. Interactive and long-running commands are allowed, since the commands are run in the user's VSCode terminal. The user may keep commands running in the background and you will be kept updated on their status along the way. Each command you execute is run in a new terminal instance.\n\n====\n\nMODES\n\n- These are the currently available modes:\n  * \"🏗️ Architect\" mode (architect) - Use this mode when you need to plan, design, or strategize before implementation. Perfect for breaking down complex problems, creating technical specifications, designing system architecture, or brainstorming solutions before coding.\n  * \"💻 Code\" mode (code) - Use this mode when you need to write, modify, or refactor code. Ideal for implementing features, fixing bugs, creating new files, or making code improvements across any programming language or framework.\n  * \"❓ Ask\" mode (ask) - Use this mode when you need explanations, documentation, or answers to technical questions. Best for understanding concepts, analyzing existing code, getting recommendations, or learning about technologies without making changes.\n  * \"🪲 Debug\" mode (debug) - Use this mode when you're troubleshooting issues, investigating errors, or diagnosing problems. Specialized in systematic debugging, adding logging, analyzing stack traces, and identifying root causes before applying fixes.\n  * \"🪃 Orchestrator\" mode (orchestrator) - Use this mode for complex, multi-step projects that require coordination across different specialties. Ideal when you need to break down large tasks into subtasks, manage workflows, or coordinate work that spans multiple domains or expertise areas.\n\n====\n\nAVAILABLE SKILLS\n\n<available_skills>\n  <skill>\n    <name>create-mcp-server</name>\n    <description>Instructions for creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that expose tools and resources for the agent to use.

However, commands may change directories in terminals, so respect working directory specified by the response to execute_command.\n- You cannot `cd` into a different directory to complete a task. You are stuck operating from '/home/useryx/codespace', so be sure to pass in the correct 'path' parameter when using tools that require a path.\n- Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.\n- Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user's environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory '/home/useryx/codespace', and if so prepend with `cd`'ing into that directory && then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from '/home/useryx/codespace'). For example, if you needed to run `npm install` in a project outside of '/home/useryx/codespace', you would need to prepend with a `cd` i.e. pseudocode for this would be `cd (path to project) && (command, in this case npm install)`.\n- Some modes have restrictions on which files they can edit. If you attempt to edit a restricted file, the operation will be rejected with a FileRestrictionError that will specify which file patterns are allowed for the current mode.\n- Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project's manifest file would help you understand the project's dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.\n  * For example, in architect mode trying to edit app.js would be rejected because architect mode can only edit files matching \"\\.md$\"\n- When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project's coding standards and best practices.\n- Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user's request efficiently and effectively. When you've completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.\n- You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. When you ask a question, provide the user with 2-4 suggested answers based on your question so they don't need to do so much typing. The suggestions should be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task. They should be ordered by priority or logical sequence. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.\n- When executing commands, if you don't see the expected output, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task. The user's terminal may be unable to stream the output back properly. If you absolutely need to see the actual terminal output, use the ask_followup_question tool to request the user to copy and paste it back to you.\n- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.\n- Your goal is to try to accomplish the user's task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.\n- NEVER end attempt_completion result with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.\n- You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with \"Great\", \"Certainly\", \"Okay\", \"Sure\". You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point. For example you should NOT say \"Great, I've updated the CSS\" but instead something like \"I've updated the CSS\". It is important you be clear and technical in your messages.\n- When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.\n- At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.\n- Before executing commands, check the \"Actively Running Terminals\" section in environment_details. If present, consider how these active processes might impact your task. For example, if a local development server is already running, you wouldn't need to start it again. If no active terminals are listed, proceed with command execution as normal.\n- MCP operations should be used one at a time, similar to other tool usage. Wait for confirmation of success before proceeding with additional operations.\n- It is critical you wait for the user's response after each tool use, in order to confirm the success of the tool use. For example, if asked to make a todo app, you would create a file, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, then create another file if needed, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, etc.\n\n====\n\nSYSTEM INFORMATION\n\nOperating System: Linux 6.1\nDefault Shell: /bin/bash\nHome Directory: /home/useryx\nCurrent Workspace Directory: /home/useryx/codespace\n\nThe Current Workspace Directory is the active VS Code project directory, and is therefore the default directory for all tool operations. New terminals will be created in the current workspace directory, however if you change directories in a terminal it will then have a different working directory; changing directories in a terminal does not modify the workspace directory, because you do not have access to change the workspace directory. When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/test/path') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.\n\n====\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n1. Analyze the user's task and set clear, achievable goals to accomplish it. Prioritize these goals in a logical order.\n2. Work through these goals sequentially, utilizing available tools one at a time as necessary. Each goal should correspond to a distinct step in your problem-solving process. You will be informed on the work completed and what's remaining as you go.\n3. Remember, you have extensive capabilities with access to a wide range of tools that can be used in powerful and clever ways as necessary to accomplish each goal. Before calling a tool, do some analysis. First, analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to gain context and insights for proceeding effectively. Next, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user's task. Go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, proceed with the tool use. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the tool (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.\n4. Once you've completed the user's task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user.\n5. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again. But DO NOT continue in pointless back and forth conversations, i.e. don't end your responses with questions or offers for further assistance.\n\n\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"简体中文\" (zh-CN) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<user_message>\n问题：【@/aiapi/@/aiapi/src/build/logs/apiroo.log 这是和roo客户端交互时的日志，20260131 04:43:27.597930 为什么会出现【 {\"status\":\"error\",\"message\":\"The tool execution failed\",\"error\":\"Invalid tool call for 'apply_diff': missing nativeArgs. This usually means the model streamed invalid or incomplete arguments and the call could not be finalized.\"}<environment_details>】，请先分析原因】 目前历史消息：【从日志看，这个报错的直接原因是：RooCode 客户端收到了一条“要执行 apply_diff”的工具调用，但该 tool call 的参数没有被完整/正确生成（缺失 nativeArgs），因此工具层无法 finalize 调用，报出：Invalid tool call for 'apply_diff': missing nativeArgs。\n\n关键证据（2026-01-31 04:43:26~04:43:27）：\n1) 服务端在 04:43:21 已成功解析并执行了一次 apply_diff（tool-bridge XML 解析正常）。\n2) 紧接着 04:43:27.597930 这一轮新的请求里，日志里出现了 {\"status\":\"error\",...\"Invalid tool call for 'apply_diff': missing nativeArgs\"}，并且该错误文本被原样拼进了后续发送给上游的 requestmessage / 工具定义区块（transformRequestForToolBridge 处可以看到它被带入）。这会显著提高上游输出不符合工具协议/输出半截 tool call 的概率。\n3) 你的系统里对 RooCode 启用了 strict client 规则（GenerationService::applyStrictClientRules）：客户端要求“每轮必须且只能一个 tool call”。一旦上游输出不完整的工具块/半截参数，在落地到 tool_calls 时就可能出现 name 有了但 arguments 为空或 JSON 不完整的情况，最终在客户端侧变成“apply_diff 没有 nativeArgs/必填字段”。\n\n更深层的机制解释：\n- 当前通道 supportsToolCalls=0，因此会走 tool-call bridge：把 tools 注入到 prompt，让上游按 XML 输出；服务端再用 XmlTagToolCallCodec 增量解析。\n- 一旦上游输出的 XML/tool call 片段不完整、被截断、或夹杂了上一次失败的错误文本导致格式偏移，解析器可能只拿到 tool 名称/部分字段；之后 strict 规则又会抑制普通文本输出并强制只保留一个 tool call，于是“残缺 tool call”会直接暴露给客户端执行层，触发 missing nativeArgs。\n\n建议修复方向（按收益/侵入性排序）：\nA) 输入清洗：在 transformRequestForToolBridge 之前，过滤掉客户端回传内容里形如 {\"status\":\"error\",\"message\":\"The tool execution failed\"...} 的工具执行错误回显（以及 environment_details 大块），避免把失败回显继续喂给上游。\nB) 输出校验兜底：在把解析结果写入 toolCalls 之前做 schema 级校验：对 apply_diff 强制要求 arguments JSON 里存在 path/diff 且为非空字符串；不满足则丢弃该 tool call，把原始内容当普通文本（或转 attempt_completion），避免把“半截 tool call”交给客户端。\nC) 解析健壮性：XmlTagToolCallCodec 已支持按 sentinel 严格匹配（parseXmlToolCalls 传入 expected sentinel）；确保每次请求都正确设置并只解析匹配本次 trigger 的块，避免误解析示例/历史残留。\nD) strict 规则策略：对 RooCode/Kilo-Code，当前策略是“无 tool call 就包 attempt_completion；多 tool call 就只留第一个”。建议增加一条：若第一个 tool call 的 arguments 解析失败/缺必填字段，则不要保留它（转 attempt_completion 或触发 read_file 兜底），从而避免 missing nativeArgs。\n\n结论：这是一次‘上游输出/解析得到的 tool call 参数不完整’导致的客户端工具执行失败，且由“错误回显进入下一轮 prompt + strict 单工具调用约束”共同放大。】【我的想法：1.工具校验：对回复的工具调用，解析后检查与客户端提供的工具调用名称，参数是否一致；不一致就丢弃掉不匹配的这个工具调用 ，这样对于非RooCode/Kilo-Code也能生效，对于RooCode/Kilo-Code， strict 规则策略还是能生效，且我们就不用修改 strict 规则策略 2.) 解析健壮性：XmlTagToolCallCodec 已支持按 sentinel 严格匹配（parseXmlToolCalls 传入 expected sentinel）；确保每次请求都正确设置并只解析匹配本次 trigger 的块，避免误解析示例/历史残留 3将我们要注入的 tools 提示要用标签包裹，并使用英文；请你评估我的改动是否合理，是否对于系统是正向的优化】【你的 3 点想法整体是正向优化，而且方向比“仅改 strict 规则”更通用（对非 RooCode/Kilo-Code 也能提升鲁棒性）。逐点评估如下：\n\n1) 工具校验（按客户端提供 tools/schema 校验 name+args）\n结论：合理且建议做，但要把“校验标准”定义清楚，否则容易误伤合法调用。\n正向点：\n- 能拦住“模型 hallucinate 的工具名/参数”以及“半截参数/空参数”导致的执行失败（你现在遇到的 missing nativeArgs 就属于这一类）。\n- 对所有客户端都生效，严格客户端只是在最后再做“必须 1 个 tool call”的整形。\n关键注意事项（避免误伤）：\n- source of truth：必须以本次请求的 tool 定义为准（建议用你们已保留的 session.tools_raw 或 RequestAdapters 提取到的 tools），不要用注入后的字符串或历史内容。\n- 参数一致性的判定：不要做“字符串完全相等”的比较（JSON key 顺序、空格、转义都会让等价 JSON 不相等）。应该：\n  - 解析 args_json/arguments 为 JSON 对象；\n  - 校验 toolName 存在于 tools 列表；\n  - 校验 required 字段齐全、类型正确（string/array/object），并可选校验 additionalProperties=false 时不允许额外字段；\n  - 对于你们当前工具（apply_diff/write_to_file/read_file 等），特别要校验必填字段非空。\n- 校验失败的处置策略：建议“丢弃该 tool call，并把其文本回退到普通文本输出/或触发 attempt_completion/read_file 兜底”，而不是直接报错继续下发给客户端执行层。\n\n2) Sentinel 严格匹配（只解析本次 trigger 对应的 XML）\n结论：非常正确，是防止误解析的核心手段，属于强正向优化。\n你们现在 parseXmlToolCalls 已经支持传入 sentinel，并且 XmlTagToolCallCodec 也支持 setSentinel + sentinelMatched_ 逻辑。建议确认两点：\n- 每次请求都生成新的 session.tool_bridge_trigger，并确保 parseXmlToolCalls 传入的 expectedSentinel 与注入给上游的 trigger 完全一致（包括大小写、斜杠）。\n- 每次解析前 reset codec 状态，避免上一次残留 buffer/state 影响下一次（你们的 codec->reset() 存在，但要确保生命周期/调用路径覆盖到）。\n\n3) 注入 tools 提示用“标签包裹 + 英文”\n结论：大概率正向，但需要控制长度与“被误解析”的风险。\n正向点：\n- 英文对大多数上游模型更稳，尤其是涉及格式约束/解析任务时。\n- 用标签包裹能让提示结构更清晰，也有助于你们后续做 prompt 截断/清洗。\n风险与建议：\n- 风险：如果你用的包裹标签与 XmlTagToolCallCodec 识别的标签（function_calls/function_call/tool/args_json 等）发生冲突，可能导致“提示区被误解析为工具调用”。\n  - 解决：提示包裹标签用完全不同且不会被解析器匹配的名字（比如 <tool_instructions>...</tool_instructions>），并且仍然依赖 sentinel 来启动解析。\n- 控制 prompt 大小：你们已经在 transformRequestForToolBridge 里做了 encodeCompactToolList，这点非常关键。继续保持“短 schema 列表 + 必填参数提示”，不要注入大段解释。\n\n总体建议（结合你当前的事故点）：\n- 你的 1)+2)+3) 是正向的系统性增强；其中 1) 的“JSON 结构化校验 + required/type 校验”是避免 missing nativeArgs 的最直接手段。\n- 另外仍建议加一条输入清洗：把类似 {\"status\":\"error\",\"message\":\"The tool execution failed\"...} 的工具执行失败回显从下一轮 prompt 中移除（否则会持续诱导上游输出异常/半截 tool call）。这不需要改 strict 规则本身，但能显著降低触发概率。】【1.【对于你们当前工具（apply_diff/write_to_file/read_file 等），特别要校验必填字段非空】这一点只能针对具体的客户端才能确定其工具，所以可以单独针对roo，kilo再做二次的apply_diff/write_to_file/read_file 校验必填字段非空 ；2.【校验失败的处置策略：建议“丢弃该 tool call，并把其文本回退到普通文本输出/或触发 attempt_completion/read_file 兜底”】这个attempt_completion/read_file 兜底只是针对roo和kilo才做的的，其他客户端可能不识别attempt_completion/read_file ；】【你这两点担忧都成立，但可以用“分层校验 + 分客户端降级策略”解决，而且不需要把核心校验只绑定 Roo/Kilo。\n\n1) “必填字段非空只能针对具体客户端工具才能确定”\n- 不必。必填字段来自 **本次请求里 tools 的 JSONSchema**（required/type/nullable/可能还有 additionalProperties），与客户端无关。\n- 所以第一层应该做“schema 驱动校验”：\n  - tool 名称必须在 tools 列表中；\n  - arguments 必须能解析为 JSON（object）；\n  - required 字段必须存在；类型必须匹配；\n  - 若 schema 指定 additionalProperties=false，则拒绝额外字段。\n- 在此基础上，你说的“对 apply_diff/write_to_file/read_file 额外做非空校验”是合理的，但它不需要靠客户端判断，而是可以作为第二层的 **通用安全/健壮性规则**：\n  - required 的 string 字段若是空字符串，基本等价于无效调用（尤其是 path/diff/content 这类）。\n  - 这会直接挡住 missing nativeArgs/空参数类问题。\n- 如果你担心误伤：可以只对“明确危险/无意义”的字段做非空（例如 apply_diff.path/diff, write_to_file.path/content, read_file.path），这些对任何客户端都成立。\n\n2) “校验失败兜底 attempt_completion/read_file 只对 Roo/Kilo 生效，其他客户端不识别”\n这个确实要区分客户端能力，但不影响你做“丢弃不合法 tool call”。关键是：\n- **丢弃不合法 tool call** 应该对所有客户端都做（这是防止执行层炸掉/产生不可预测副作用的安全线）。\n- 丢弃后的“降级输出”要按 clientType 分支：\n  - 对 Roo/Kilo（strict 工具客户端）：可用 attempt_completion/read_file 兜底，因为它们要求每轮必须一个工具调用。\n  - 对其他普通 OpenAI 兼容客户端：\n    - 如果它们没有工具/不支持工具：就回退为普通文本输出（OutputTextDone），不要生成 attempt_completion 这种非 OpenAI 标准工具。\n    - 如果它们支持原生 tool_calls：则应返回标准 tool_calls；校验失败就返回文本或返回 error（看你们 API 的错误语义设计）。\n\n推荐的最终策略（不改 strict 的前提下）：\n- Stage A（通用）：基于 tools JSONSchema 做 tool call 校验（name + JSON 可解析 + required/type），失败就丢弃。\n- Stage B（通用但更强）：对关键 string 参数做 non-empty 校验（尤其是 path/diff/content）。\n- Stage C（按客户端）：若丢弃后 toolCalls 为空：\n  - strict 客户端：wrap 为 attempt_completion（或按你们现有 generateForcedToolCall/strict 规则链路）；\n  - 非 strict 客户端：保留/返回普通文本。\n\n这样既满足你“非 Roo/Kilo 不要用 attempt_completion/read_file”这个约束，也能把 missing nativeArgs 这类问题在源头截断。】【好，请按你的推荐策略修改，再加上：【注入 tools 提示用“标签包裹 + 英文” 结论：大概率正向，但需要控制长度与“被误解析”的风险。 正向点：\n英文对大多数上游模型更稳，尤其是涉及格式约束/解析任务时。\n用标签包裹能让提示结构更清晰，也有助于你们后续做 prompt 截断/清洗。 风险与建议：\n风险：如果你用的包裹标签与 XmlTagToolCallCodec
