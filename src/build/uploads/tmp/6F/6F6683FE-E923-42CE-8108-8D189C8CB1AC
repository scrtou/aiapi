{"model":"GPT-5.2 Pro","temperature":0,"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.\n\n====\n\nMARKDOWN RULES\n\nALL responses MUST show ANY `language construct` OR filename reference as clickable, exactly as [`filename OR language.declaration()`](relative/file/path.ext:line); line is required for `syntax` and optional for filename links. This applies to ALL markdown responses and ALSO those in attempt_completion\n\n====\n\nTOOL USE\n\nYou have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. Use the provider-native tool-calling mechanism. Do not include XML markup or examples. You must call at least one tool per assistant response. Prefer calling as many tools as are reasonably needed in a single response to reduce back-and-forth and complete tasks faster.\n\n\t# Tool Use Guidelines\n\n1. Assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.\n2. Choose the most appropriate tool based on the task and the tool descriptions provided. Assess if you need additional information to proceed, and which of the available tools would be most effective for gathering this information. For example using the list_files tool is more effective than running a command like `ls` in the terminal. It's critical that you think about each available tool and use the one that best fits the current step in the task.\n3. If multiple actions are needed, you may use multiple tools in a single message when appropriate, or use tools iteratively across messages. Each tool use should be informed by the results of previous tool uses. Do not assume the outcome of any tool use. Each step must be informed by the previous step's result.\n\nBy carefully considering the user's response after tool executions, you can react accordingly and make informed decisions about how to proceed with the task. This iterative process helps ensure the overall success and accuracy of your work.\n\n====\n\nCAPABILITIES\n\n- You have access to tools that let you execute CLI commands on the user's computer, list files, view source code definitions, regex search, read and write files, and ask follow-up questions. These tools help you effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks, such as writing code, making edits or improvements to existing files, understanding the current state of a project, performing system operations, and much more.\n- When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/home/useryx/codespace') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.\n- You can use the execute_command tool to run commands on the user's computer whenever you feel it can help accomplish the user's task. When you need to execute a CLI command, you must provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, since they are more flexible and easier to run. Interactive and long-running commands are allowed, since the commands are run in the user's VSCode terminal. The user may keep commands running in the background and you will be kept updated on their status along the way. Each command you execute is run in a new terminal instance.\n\n====\n\nMODES\n\n- These are the currently available modes:\n  * \"🏗️ Architect\" mode (architect) - Use this mode when you need to plan, design, or strategize before implementation. Perfect for breaking down complex problems, creating technical specifications, designing system architecture, or brainstorming solutions before coding.\n  * \"💻 Code\" mode (code) - Use this mode when you need to write, modify, or refactor code. Ideal for implementing features, fixing bugs, creating new files, or making code improvements across any programming language or framework.\n  * \"❓ Ask\" mode (ask) - Use this mode when you need explanations, documentation, or answers to technical questions. Best for understanding concepts, analyzing existing code, getting recommendations, or learning about technologies without making changes.\n  * \"🪲 Debug\" mode (debug) - Use this mode when you're troubleshooting issues, investigating errors, or diagnosing problems. Specialized in systematic debugging, adding logging, analyzing stack traces, and identifying root causes before applying fixes.\n  * \"🪃 Orchestrator\" mode (orchestrator) - Use this mode for complex, multi-step projects that require coordination across different specialties. Ideal when you need to break down large tasks into subtasks, manage workflows, or coordinate work that spans multiple domains or expertise areas.\n\n====\n\nAVAILABLE SKILLS\n\n<available_skills>\n  <skill>\n    <name>create-mcp-server</name>\n    <description>Instructions for creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that expose tools and resources for the agent to use.

However, commands may change directories in terminals, so respect working directory specified by the response to execute_command.\n- You cannot `cd` into a different directory to complete a task. You are stuck operating from '/home/useryx/codespace', so be sure to pass in the correct 'path' parameter when using tools that require a path.\n- Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.\n- Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user's environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory '/home/useryx/codespace', and if so prepend with `cd`'ing into that directory && then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from '/home/useryx/codespace'). For example, if you needed to run `npm install` in a project outside of '/home/useryx/codespace', you would need to prepend with a `cd` i.e. pseudocode for this would be `cd (path to project) && (command, in this case npm install)`.\n- Some modes have restrictions on which files they can edit. If you attempt to edit a restricted file, the operation will be rejected with a FileRestrictionError that will specify which file patterns are allowed for the current mode.\n- Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project's manifest file would help you understand the project's dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.\n  * For example, in architect mode trying to edit app.js would be rejected because architect mode can only edit files matching \"\\.md$\"\n- When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project's coding standards and best practices.\n- Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user's request efficiently and effectively. When you've completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.\n- You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. When you ask a question, provide the user with 2-4 suggested answers based on your question so they don't need to do so much typing. The suggestions should be specific, actionable, and directly related to the completed task. They should be ordered by priority or logical sequence. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.\n- When executing commands, if you don't see the expected output, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task. The user's terminal may be unable to stream the output back properly. If you absolutely need to see the actual terminal output, use the ask_followup_question tool to request the user to copy and paste it back to you.\n- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.\n- Your goal is to try to accomplish the user's task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.\n- NEVER end attempt_completion result with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.\n- You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with \"Great\", \"Certainly\", \"Okay\", \"Sure\". You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point. For example you should NOT say \"Great, I've updated the CSS\" but instead something like \"I've updated the CSS\". It is important you be clear and technical in your messages.\n- When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.\n- At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.\n- Before executing commands, check the \"Actively Running Terminals\" section in environment_details. If present, consider how these active processes might impact your task. For example, if a local development server is already running, you wouldn't need to start it again. If no active terminals are listed, proceed with command execution as normal.\n- MCP operations should be used one at a time, similar to other tool usage. Wait for confirmation of success before proceeding with additional operations.\n- It is critical you wait for the user's response after each tool use, in order to confirm the success of the tool use. For example, if asked to make a todo app, you would create a file, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, then create another file if needed, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, etc.\n\n====\n\nSYSTEM INFORMATION\n\nOperating System: Linux 6.1\nDefault Shell: /bin/bash\nHome Directory: /home/useryx\nCurrent Workspace Directory: /home/useryx/codespace\n\nThe Current Workspace Directory is the active VS Code project directory, and is therefore the default directory for all tool operations. New terminals will be created in the current workspace directory, however if you change directories in a terminal it will then have a different working directory; changing directories in a terminal does not modify the workspace directory, because you do not have access to change the workspace directory. When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('/test/path') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.\n\n====\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n1. Analyze the user's task and set clear, achievable goals to accomplish it. Prioritize these goals in a logical order.\n2. Work through these goals sequentially, utilizing available tools one at a time as necessary. Each goal should correspond to a distinct step in your problem-solving process. You will be informed on the work completed and what's remaining as you go.\n3. Remember, you have extensive capabilities with access to a wide range of tools that can be used in powerful and clever ways as necessary to accomplish each goal. Before calling a tool, do some analysis. First, analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to gain context and insights for proceeding effectively. Next, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user's task. Go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, proceed with the tool use. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the tool (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.\n4. Once you've completed the user's task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user.\n5. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again. But DO NOT continue in pointless back and forth conversations, i.e. don't end your responses with questions or offers for further assistance.\n\n\n====\n\nUSER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability.\n\nLanguage Preference:\nYou should always speak and think in the \"简体中文\" (zh-CN) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.\n"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<user_message>\n'aiapi/doc/session' 检查代码中目前会话连续性的实现是否有问题\n</user_message>"},{"type":"text","text":"[read_file for folder 'aiapi/doc/session']\nFolder listing:\n├── README.md\n├── session_continuity_refactor_design.md\n└── session_continuity_refactor_development_plan.md\n\n\n--- File Contents ---\n\n[read_file for 'aiapi/doc/session/README.md']\nFile: aiapi/doc/session/README.md\n 1 | # Session 文档索引\n 2 | \n 3 | 本目录用于沉淀 aiapi 的会话连续性（session continuity）相关设计与计划。\n 4 | \n 5 | ## 文档\n 6 | - [会话连续性重构设计方案](./session_continuity_refactor_design.md)\n 7 | - [会话连续性重构开发计划](./session_continuity_refactor_development_plan.md)\n 8 | \n 9 | ## 决策（已确认）\n10 | ### previous_response_id 未命中时如何创建新会话的 sessionId？\n11 | - 采用方案 2：生成新的 `sess_<uuid>`\n12 | \n13 | > 说明：由于 ResponseIndex 为纯内存，重启或清理导致的 miss 将自然降级为新会话。\n14 | \n15 | ### ResponseIndex 清理策略默认值\n16 | - `maxEntries`: 200000\n17 | - `maxAge`: 6h\n18 | \n\n[read_file for 'aiapi/doc/session/session_continuity_refactor_design.md']\nFile: aiapi/doc/session/session_continuity_refactor_design.md\n  1 | # 会话连续性重构设计方案（Chat Completions + /v1/responses）\n  2 | \n  3 | ## 1. 背景与目标\n  4 | \n  5 | aiapi 需要同时兼容两类 OpenAI 兼容接口：\n  6 | - Chat Completions API\n  7 | - /v1/responses API\n  8 | \n  9 | 本次重构目标：\n 10 | 1) **优雅与清晰**：结构清晰、逻辑清晰、低耦合。\n 11 | 2) **统一主键**：`Session` 类全局 map 的 key 仍为 **sessionId**（即“会话连续模式决定的会话id”）。\n 12 | 3) **/v1/responses 规则**：\n 13 |    - 若请求携带 `previous_response_id`，则优先使用它续接会话。\n 14 |    - 若不携带，则按配置（ZeroWidth / Hash）选择会话连续模式。\n 15 |    - 无论采用哪种，响应中必须包含 `response.id`。\n 16 | 4) **输入覆盖**：/v1/responses 支持从 `input`、`messages`、`input_items` 中解析 ZeroWidth 会话信息。\n 17 | 5) **Hash 规则保持现状**：不修改当前 hash 的计算规则。\n 18 | 6) **ResponseIndex 纯内存**：允许重启丢失；丢失后行为可预测（降级为新会话）。\n 19 | \n 20 | 非目标：\n 21 | - 不引入 DB 持久化（本阶段）。\n 22 | - 不更改模型调用、工具调用、鉴权等其它业务逻辑。\n 23 | \n 24 | ---\n 25 | \n 26 | ## 2. 核心概念与不变量\n 27 | \n 28 | ### 2.1 术语\n 29 | - **TrackingMode**：`ZeroWidth` 或 `Hash`（由配置决定）。\n 30 | - **sessionId**：会话主键，Session 全局 map key。\n 31 | - **responseId**：/v1/responses 每次请求生成的响应实例 id（必须返回）。\n 32 | - **previous_response_id**：/v1/responses 用于续接上一次响应的指针。\n 33 | - **ResponseIndex**：内存索引 `responseId -> sessionId`。\n 34 | - **ContinuityResolver**：会话连续性决策器：从请求解析出应该使用的 sessionId。\n 35 | \n 36 | ### 2.2 不变量（必须满足）\n 37 | 1) **Session 存取永远以 sessionId 为唯一 key**。\n 38 | 2) /v1/responses：**每次都生成 responseId 并返回**。\n 39 | 3) /v1/responses：如果携带 previous_response_id，**必须优先**用它续接（通过 ResponseIndex）。\n 40 | 4) 为保证 SSE/并发续接：**responseId 生成后要尽早 bind 到 ResponseIndex**。\n 41 | \n 42 | ---\n 43 | \n 44 | ## 3. 优先级规则（最核心业务规则）\n 45 | \n 46 | ### 3.1 Chat Completions\n 47 | 只按配置模式决定 sessionId：\n 48 | - ZeroWidth：从 `messages` 中解码 sessionId；解码失败则创建新 sessionId。\n 49 | - Hash：按现有 hash 规则计算 sessionId。\n 50 | \n 51 | ### 3.2 /v1/responses\n 52 | 优先级固定：\n 53 | 1) 若请求带 `previous_response_id`：\n 54 |    - ResponseIndex 命中：使用命中的 sessionId\n 55 |    - ResponseIndex 未命中：创建新会话（见第 4 节“降级策略”）\n 56 | 2) 若请求不带 `previous_response_id`：按配置（ZeroWidth / Hash）决定 sessionId。\n 57 | \n 58 | > 这条规则使“第一轮不带 previous_response_id”不会不确定：第一轮按配置得到 sessionId；第二轮若带 previous_response_id，则通过 ResponseIndex 反查回第一轮 sessionId，从而续接。\n 59 | \n 60 | ---\n 61 | \n 62 | ## 4.

`sessionManager/ResponseIndex.{h,cpp}`\n 21 | - `sessionManager/ContinuityResolver.{h,cpp}`\n 22 | - `sessionManager/TextExtractor`（或工具函数文件）\n 23 | \n 24 | 验收：\n 25 | - 编译通过\n 26 | - 最小单测/自测：\n 27 |   - ResponseIndex bind/get/cleanup\n 28 |   - ContinuityResolver：\n 29 |     - responses + previous_response_id hit/miss\n 30 |     - zeroWidth decode ok/miss\n 31 |     - hash path 调用旧逻辑（结果一致）\n 32 | \n 33 | \n 34 | ### M2：Adapter 收敛请求结构\n 35 | 交付：\n 36 | - `GenerationRequest` 新增：\n 37 |   - endpointType（Chat/Responses）\n 38 |   - previousResponseId（optional）\n 39 | - `RequestAdapters`：\n 40 |   - responses adapter 解析 previous_response_id\n 41 |   - 抽取 input/messages/input_items 的文本集合\n 42 | \n 43 | 验收：\n 44 | - 对同一请求，TextExtractor 输出稳定可预测\n 45 | \n 46 | \n 47 | ### M3：GenerationService 主流程接入\n 48 | 交付：\n 49 | - GenerationService：\n 50 |   - 开头调用 ContinuityResolver 得到 sessionId\n 51 |   - Session 全局 map 用 sessionId getOrCreate\n 52 |   - gate key 统一为 sessionId\n 53 |   - responses：生成 responseId 并 **Early bind** 到 ResponseIndex\n 54 |   - Completed：Late commit（session history/hash/lastResponseId/time）\n 55 | \n 56 | 验收：\n 57 | - 两轮 responses 续接通过\n 58 | - SSE 快速续接通过\n 59 | \n 60 | \n 61 | ### M4：Sinks/Controller 输出契约确认\n 62 | 交付：\n 63 | - ResponsesJsonSink/ResponsesSseSink：确保 `id` 总能输出\n 64 | \n 65 | 验收：\n 66 | - responses 的 JSON 与 SSE 均能在早期拿到 responseId\n 67 | \n 68 | ---\n 69 | \n 70 | ## 2. 任务拆分（Todo）\n 71 | \n 72 | ### 2.1 代码结构\n 73 | - [ ] 新增：`aiapi/src/sessionManager/ResponseIndex.h/.cpp`\n 74 | - [ ] 新增：`aiapi/src/sessionManager/ContinuityResolver.h/.cpp`\n 75 | - [ ] 新增：`aiapi/src/sessionManager/TextExtractor.h/.cpp`（或 `SessionTextUtils.*`）\n 76 | \n 77 | ### 2.2 接口改造\n 78 | - [ ] 修改：`GenerationRequest.h` 增加 endpointType、previousResponseId\n 79 | - [ ] 修改：`RequestAdapters.cpp` 负责填充上述字段\n 80 | \n 81 | ### 2.3 主流程改造\n 82 | - [ ] 修改：`GenerationService.cpp` 接入 ContinuityResolver\n 83 | - [ ] 修改：`Session.cpp/Session.h`（必要时）补齐 session_st 字段语义（sessionId/lastResponseId 等）\n 84 | - [ ] Gate key：统一 sessionId\n 85 | \n 86 | ### 2.4 输出层\n 87 | - [ ] 修改：`ResponsesJsonSink.*`、`ResponsesSseSink.*` 确保 id 输出\n 88 | \n 89 | ---\n 90 | \n 91 | ## 3. 关键风险点与规避\n 92 | \n 93 | 1) **Early bind 时机太晚**导致 SSE 场景第二轮 miss\n 94 | - 规避：在 Started 事件 emit 前就 bind\n 95 | \n 96 | 2) **Hash 规则误改**导致历史会话全部断链\n 97 | - 规避：Hash 计算逻辑完全复用旧函数；加回归对比日志/测试\n 98 | \n 99 | 3) **ZeroWidth 文本来源不全**导致某些客户端断链\n100 | - 规避：TextExtractor 覆盖 input + messages + input_items；并取最后出现的零宽 id\n101 | \n102 | 4) **ResponseIndex 清理策略过激**导致续接不稳定\n103 | - 规避：默认 maxAge 足够长（例如 1h/6h），maxEntries 足够大；清理只在插入或定时触发\n104 | \n105 | ---\n106 | \n107 | ## 4. 验收 Checklist（最终）\n108 | - [ ] Chat：ZeroWidth/Hash 两模式均正常，Hash 结果不变\n109 | - [ ] Responses：\n110 |   - [ ] 每次返回 `id`\n111 |   - [ ] previous_response_id 优先续接\n112 |   - [ ] previous_response_id miss -> 新会话（符合选定策略）\n113 |   - [ ] 支持 input/messages/input_items 的 ZeroWidth 解析\n114 |   - [ ] SSE 快速续接稳定（验证 Early bind）\n115 | - [ ] Session 全局 map key 仍为 sessionId\n116 | - [ ] 关键日志具备：source/sessionId/responseId/hit-miss\n117 | \n118 | "},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible

生成 responseId（[`chatSession::generateResponseId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:1041) 被调用点在 [`GenerationService::executeGuardedWithSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.cpp:468)）\\n  - 立即绑定 [`ResponseIndex::bind()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ResponseIndex.cpp:20)：`response_id -> session.curConversationId`（见 [`GenerationService::executeGuardedWithSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.cpp:472)）\\n- 请求结束时会话会“转移并删除旧 sessionId”：[`chatSession::commitSessionTransfer()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:362) 在会话转移中执行 [`chatSession::delSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:416)（删除 oldSessionId）。\\n- **转移完成后才“重新 bind”**：见 [`GenerationService::executeGuardedWithSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.cpp:549) 后的再次 [`ResponseIndex::bind()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ResponseIndex.cpp:20)（[`GenerationService::executeGuardedWithSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.cpp:550)）。\\n\\n### 问题本质\\n在“会话已转移并删除 oldSessionId”到“ResponseIndex 重新 bind 到新 sessionId”之间存在非常短的窗口：\\n- 此时 `previous_response_id` 仍会命中到旧 mapping（`response_id -> oldSessionId`），但 oldSessionId 可能已被 [`chatSession::delSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:416) 删除。\\n- 下一轮请求进入 [`ContinuityResolver::resolve()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ContinuityResolver.cpp:26) 时，虽然 [`ResponseIndex::tryGetSessionId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ResponseIndex.cpp:11) 命中，但随后的 [`chatSession::getOrCreateSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:190) 会因为 session 不存在而创建一个“空新会话”，表现为 **续聊断链/上下文丢失**。\\n\\n### 建议修复（最小改动、与设计目标一致）\\n把“responseId -> nextSessionId”的绑定前移到会话转移之前，消除竞态：\\n- 在 [`chatSession::prepareNextSessionId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:325) 之后、调用 [`chatSession::coverSessionresponse()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:432) 之前（即 [`GenerationService::executeGuardedWithSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.cpp:535)～[`GenerationService::executeGuardedWithSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.cpp:553) 这段）新增一次：\\n  - `ResponseIndex.bind(response_id, session.nextSessionId)`（对应 [`ResponseIndex::bind()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ResponseIndex.cpp:20)）\\n- 然后可以删除/保留末尾那次“转移后再 bind”。即使保留，至少不会再出现“删除旧会话后才更新索引”的窗口。\\n\\n这也更贴合文档强调的“Early bind + 可预测降级”，且不会影响 Started 事件尽早拿到 id（Started 仍可先发）。\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2) Response API 的旧逻辑仍把 curConversationId 当成 previous_response_id 使用（语义分裂，导致不同路径行为不一致）\\n\\n你现在同时存在两套“responses 续接”的思路：\\n\\n### (A) 新链路（符合文档）\\n- [`ContinuityResolver::resolve()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ContinuityResolver.cpp:26) 对 responses：\\n  - `previous_response_id` 命中 [`ResponseIndex::tryGetSessionId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ResponseIndex.cpp:11) → 得到内部 `sessionId`\\n  - miss → [`ContinuityResolver::generateNewSessionId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ContinuityResolver.cpp:81) 新建 `sess_...`\\n- 然后统一走 [`chatSession::getOrCreateSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:190) 用 `sessionId` 作为 session_map key。\\n\\n### (B) 旧链路（与文档冲突/已过时）\\n- [`chatSession::createOrUpdateResponseSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:130) 的分支仍在：\\n  - 当 `has_previous_response_id` 时，直接用 `session.curConversationId` 去查历史（日志还写“检测到 previous_response_id: curConversationId”）。见 [`chatSession::createOrUpdateResponseSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:137)\\n- 以及 [`chatSession::createOrUpdateSessionByPreviousResponseId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:226) 仍包含“miss 时用 previous_response_id 作为 sessionId 创建会话”的行为（[`chatSession::createOrUpdateSessionByPreviousResponseId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:240)～[`chatSession::createOrUpdateSessionByPreviousResponseId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:249)），这与文档已确认的“miss → 新 `sess_<uuid>`”相冲突。\\n\\n### 风险\\n只要系统中仍有任一入口走到旧链路，就会出现：\\n- 同一个 `previous_response_id`，在新链路下会映射到内部 `sess_...`；在旧链路下可能直接把 `previous_response_id` 当 sessionId 用。\\n- 结果就是“某些请求续得上、某些请求续不上/续到另一条链路”。\\n\\n### 建议\\n- 明确 responses 的唯一权威入口：只用 [`ContinuityResolver::resolve()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ContinuityResolver.cpp:26) + [`chatSession::getOrCreateSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:190)。\\n- 将旧入口（至少 responses 部分）改为：\\n  - 要么彻底不再被调用（标记 deprecated 并移除路由调用点）\\n  - 要么内部直接委托到新链路（避免语义分裂）。\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3) “每轮会话转移”与 responses 的 previous_response_id 语义需要明确（目前靠二次 bind 勉强兜住，但逻辑绕）\\n\\n目前流程是：\\n- responseId 先 bind 到 `curConversationId`（旧）→ 后续再 bind 到转移后的 `curConversationId`（新）\\n\\n这能工作，但很容易引入类似第 1 点的竞态与维护困惑。把 “bind 到 nextSessionId” 提前后，responses 的语义会更清晰：\\n- `previous_response_id` 永远解析到“下一轮应该续接的 sessionId”（也就是你已经 embed/转移到的那条）。\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 一句话建议优先级\\n1) 先修竞态：在 [`chatSession::prepareNextSessionId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:325) 之后提前把 [`ResponseIndex::bind()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/ResponseIndex.cpp:20) 绑到 `session.nextSessionId`，消除“删旧会话后才更新索引”的窗口。\\n2) 收敛入口：确保 responses 不再走 [`chatSession::createOrUpdateResponseSession()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:130) / [`chatSession::createOrUpdateSessionByPreviousResponseId()`](aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp:226) 这种旧语义路径。\\n\\n以上问题足以解释“会话连续性偶发不稳定/重启后断链/并发时续不上”的现象。\"}"}}]},{"role":"tool","tool_call_id":"call_b5b6f68d128960f24f53ad61","content":"<user_message>\n请你修改\n</user_message>"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\naiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.cpp\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\naiapi/doc/session/session_continuity_refactor_design.md,aiapi/doc/session/session_continuity_refactor_development_plan.md,aiapi/src/build/logs/aiapi.log,aiapi/src/apipoint/chaynsapi/chaynsapi.cpp,aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.h,aiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.h,aiapi/src/sessionManager/GenerationService.cpp,aiapi/src/sessionManager/Session.cpp\n\n# Current Time\nCurrent time in ISO 8601 UTC format: 2026-02-03T14:18:39.514Z\nUser time zone: America/Los_Angeles, UTC-8:00\n\n# Current Cost\n$0.00\n\n# Current Mode\n<slug>code</slug>\n<name>💻 Code</name>\n<model>GPT-5.2 Pro</model>\n<tool_format>native</tool_format>\nYou have not created a todo list yet.

Slice mode is ideal for initial file exploration, understanding overall structure, reading configuration/data files, or when you need a specific line range. Use it when you don't have a target line number. PREFER indentation mode when you have a specific line number from search results, error messages, or definition lookups - it guarantees complete, syntactically valid code blocks without mid-function truncation. IMPORTANT: Indentation mode requires anchor_line to be useful. Without it, only header content (imports) is returned. By default, returns up to 2000 lines per file. Lines longer than 2000 characters are truncated. Supports text extraction from PDF and DOCX files, but may not handle other binary files properly.
